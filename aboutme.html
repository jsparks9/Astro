Starting November 2019, I have been studying V&#x0113;dic astrology and making use of it for predictions. There are many people who have been studying the topic for far longer to a much greater degree of success in the art, but my heavy use of good reference texts along with automatically generated lookup algorithms allows me to gain and give much deeper insight into horoscopes than my more experienced counterparts. For this purpose, I have written thousands of lines of code utilizing text from many expert reference texts that give quick insight into a horoscope. Combining this approach with skill and intuition gained from practical experience, it is discerned what elements apply and which do no apply to a given horoscope. All in all, consultations are quick and easy to give due to the tools I have developed. Hence, the rate charged for consultations is rather nominal. </p>
